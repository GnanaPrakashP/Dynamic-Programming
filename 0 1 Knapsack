Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

6 types of 0 1 Knapsack

1) Subset sum
2) Equal sum partition
3) Count of subset sum
4) Minimum subset sum diff
5) Target sum
6) No of subsets with given difference
